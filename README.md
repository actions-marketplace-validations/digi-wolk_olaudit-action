# About

Github Action for the [OSS license auditor](https://github.com/digi-wolk/oss-license-auditor) project (`olAudit`)

# Usage

Example (uses Github's default token, scoped to the repository that runs it)

```yaml
name: OSS License Auditor

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  oss-license-auditor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: OSS License Auditor
        uses: digi-wolk/olaudit@v1
        with:
          path: .
```

In order to avoid facing GitHub API rate limits, we use Github Action's default token which is set as an environment
variable called `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
This token is automatically generated by GitHub and is scoped to the repository that is currently running the action.
You can override the value with a custom personal access token (PAT) if it needs to access private repositories.

Example with Personal Access Token (PAT):

```yaml
name: OSS License Auditor

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  oss-license-auditor:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: OSS License Auditor
        uses: digi-wolk/olaudit@v1
        with:
          path: .
```

You need to generate a Personal Access Token with necessary permissions and add it as a secret in your repository.
In this example we used `GITHUB_PAT` as the secret name.
